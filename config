# please adjust after installation!

# which partition should be used for installation to harddisk:
# e.g.: "/dev/hda1"  -> install grml on /dev/hda1
PARTITION=""         # empty by default to avoid accidents

# install lilo into mbr (master boot record) of the following device:
# e.g.: "/dev/hda"   -> install in mbr
# e.g.: "/dev/hda1"  -> don't touch mbr but write into partition only
BOOT_PARTITION=""    # empty by default to avoid accidents

# which bootmanager should be installed:
# supported values: 'grub' and 'lilo' (lilo is default)
BOOT_MANAGER="lilo"

# which filesystem should be used for installation:
# e.g.: "ext3"
# valid values: ext3, ext2, jfs, xfs, reiserfs, reiser4
# notice: reiser4 only supported with grml >= 0.5
