Description: make a harddisk installation of grml
 grml2hd is a script that installs a running grml system
 on your hard disk. It just copies the running system
 and does some further magic (adjust user setup, install
 bootloader,..) to get a working harddisk installation of
 grml.
 Please do NOT use grml2hd if you aren't an experienced
 Debian user. Thanks!
 .
 Use it with care! Also take a look at grml2hd-utils.
