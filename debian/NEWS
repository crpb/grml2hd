grml2hd (1.5.5) unstable; urgency=low

  grml2hd is no longer available inside $PATH. Too many users
  who can't properly deal with Debian/unstable are using grml2hd
  to install their regular desktop system even though we print
  a strong warning. So just provide grml2hd to the ones who know
  how and where to find grml2hd.
