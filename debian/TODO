TODO for grml2hd
================

high priority
-------------

  - support SW-RAID for grub
  - "mounting target" => mount several partitions to one target and
    don't run mkfs then but just copy grml to the target
  - test cases for customization of grml2hd via the file
    /etc/grml2hd/customization => make sure all relevant variables
    are present where needed

low priority
------------

  - artwork for grub bootloader ("splash" image like present within lilo)
  - set label (grml/grml-root) for partition where grml is installed to
    -> deprecated by use of root=UUID=... - nor?
  - choose and mount /$DIRECTORY (via /etc/fstab)
  - make a small script which simply copies all files to a
    mounted partition (for experts only)
