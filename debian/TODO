TODO for grml2hd
================

high priority
-------------

  - "mounting target" => mount several partitions to one target and
    don't run mkfs then but just copy grml to the target
  - support SW-RAID for grub

low priority
------------

  - mkfs.reiserfs (and some other fs-utils) are missing on
    grml-small - find a solution how to install them
    automatically through grml2hd
  - set label (grml/grml-root) for partition where grml is installed to
    -> deprecated by use of root=UUID=... - nor?
  - choose and mount /$DIRECTORY (via /etc/fstab)
  - make a small script which simply copies all files to a
    mounted partition (for experts only)

testing
-------

  - lilo vs. grub dialog implemented => test several use cases
  - configuration system: enable specific dialogs only so
    optimization for special grml flavours is possible
    => heavy testing, make sure dependencies of variables are
       clarified and robust
